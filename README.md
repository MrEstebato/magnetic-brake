# Magnetic brake Simulation on Matlab

### Simulation
[comment]: <> (Here goes the animation .gif of the simulation)

This repository contains a `reto_freno_magnetico.m` that simulates a falling piece of a mechanical game and the structure applies 2 phases of magnetic brake
to stop it before it hits the floor, the mass can be variable.
