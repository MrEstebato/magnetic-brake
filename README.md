# Magnetic brake Simulation on Matlab

### Simulation
[comment]: <> (Here goes the animation .gif of the simulation)

This repository contains a `reto_freno_magnetico.m` that simulates a falling piece of a mechanical game and the structure applies 2 phases of magnetic brake
to stop it before it hits the floor, the mass can be variable.

This code simulates both the starting sequence by lifting the structure, then it drops it down to the first and second magnetic brake until it finally stops
